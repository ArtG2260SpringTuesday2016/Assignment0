## Read the following
- [ ] [Eloquent JavaScript chapter 1](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)
- [ ] [Eloquent JavaScript chapter 2](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html) I do not expect you to have a mastery of loops (`for` and `while`) updating variables succinctly (iterators) or `alert`
